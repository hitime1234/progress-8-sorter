# united-kingdom-progress-8-sorter
I made this to see if i could rank the schools of uk by the progress 8 average. NOTE the data for progress 8  scores was taken from .gov.uk website.  
# what can it do?
it can rank in order of schools using a csv file from the uk goverment.
it can search through the csv and find the progress 8 score average.
it can find the rank on specific school.

# note
you MUST HAVE THE CSV FOR THIS.
THE one tested is ks4 final from 2018-2019 school year
CSV file can be obtained here:
https://www.compare-school-performance.service.gov.uk/download-data?currentstep=datatypes&regiontype=all&la=0&downloadYear=2018-2019&datatypes=ks4&datatypes=ks4mats

#other notation
in no way this is supposed to be a indefinite ranking just guess based on one area of progress goverment uses to judge if school is doing well.
